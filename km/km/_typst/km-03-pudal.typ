= The Relation Between Bloom's Taxonomy and PUDAL Cycle
<the-relation-between-blooms-taxonomy-and-pudal-cycle>
I often model smart systems to kavea PUDAL cycle: \[P\]erception of
Stimuli, \[U\]nderstanding, \[D\]ecision making or Deigning Plan of
Action, \[A\]cting oe Plan Executing, and \[L\]earning or Evaluationg.
what is the ost logical relation bewenn Bloom Taxonomy and PUDAL cycle?

The most logical relation between your #strong[PUDAL] cycle and
#strong[Bloom's Taxonomy] is that #strong[PUDAL represents the
#emph[Process Flow] (Time), while Bloom's represents the
#emph[Processing Depth] (Complexity).]

You can visualize this as a matrix: PUDAL is the horizontal axis (steps
you take), and Bloom's is the vertical axis (how deeply you think at
each step).

Here is the direct mapping of where each stage of your Smart System
(PUDAL) intersects with the cognitive hierarchy of Bloom's Taxonomy.

== 1. The Direct Phase Mapping
<the-direct-phase-mapping>
#strong[\[P\] Perception of Stimuli $arrow.r$ Bloom Level: Remembering]
\* #strong[The Logic:] Perception is the retrieval or recognition of
data. In a smart system, this is "sensing." In Bloom's terms, this is
the lowest level of cognition: recognizing that a specific fact or
stimulus exists. \* #emph[Bloom Action:] Recognizing, Listing,
Describing (the raw input).

#strong[\[U\] Understanding $arrow.r$ Bloom Level: Understanding] \*
#strong[The Logic:] This is a 1:1 match. The system (or person) acts on
the perceived data to determine context. It translates raw signals into
meaning. \* #emph[Bloom Action:] Interpreting, Classifying, Summarizing
(the context).

#strong[\[D\] Decision/Design $arrow.r$ Bloom Level: Analyzing &
Creating] \* #strong[The Logic:] This is the most cognitively demanding
phase. \* #strong[Decision] requires #strong[Analyzing];: Breaking down
the situation to look for patterns or causes. \* #strong[Design]
requires #strong[Creating];: Synthesizing those parts to formulate a new
plan or strategy. \* #emph[Bloom Action:] Differentiating (options),
Organizing (logic), Planning (the output).

#strong[\[A\] Acting $arrow.r$ Bloom Level: Applying] \* #strong[The
Logic:] You are executing the plan designed in the previous step. In
Bloom's, "Applying" is defined as using a procedure in a given
situation. \* #emph[Bloom Action:] Executing, Implementing, Using (the
plan).

#strong[\[L\] Learning/Evaluating $arrow.r$ Bloom Level: Evaluating] \*
#strong[The Logic:] The system looks at the result of the Action vs.~the
intent of the Design. It judges the quality of the outcome to update the
model. \* #emph[Bloom Action:] Checking, Critiquing, Judging (the delta
between expected and actual).

== 2. The Integrated Model (The "Smart Loop")
<the-integrated-model-the-smart-loop>
To map this logically, you should view the relationship as a
#strong[Control Loop] where Bloom's Taxonomy dictates the "intelligence"
of the PUDAL cycle.

There are two ways to view this relationship:

=== A. The "Reflexive" PUDAL (Low-Level Bloom)
<a.-the-reflexive-pudal-low-level-bloom>
If the system is simple (automation), the PUDAL cycle stays at the
bottom of Bloom's: \* #strong[P:] Detects heat (Remember). \*
#strong[U:] Interprets as "Too Hot" (Understand). \* #strong[D:] Selects
pre-set rule "Turn on Fan" (Basic Application/Selection). \* #strong[A:]
Turns on Fan (Apply). \* #strong[L:] Checks if temp dropped (Basic
Evaluation).

=== B. The "Cognitive" PUDAL (High-Level Bloom)
<b.-the-cognitive-pudal-high-level-bloom>
If the system is smart (AI/Human Expert), the PUDAL cycle reaches the
top of Bloom's: \* #strong[P:] Detects market anomaly (Remember). \*
#strong[U:] Interprets as a new emerging trend (Understand). \*
#strong[D:] #strong[Synthesizes] a new investment strategy to exploit
the trend (#strong[Create/Design];). \* #strong[A:] Executes the trade
(#strong[Apply];). \* #strong[L:] #strong[Critiques] the strategy's
validity against global variables to update its mental model
(#strong[Evaluate];).

== 3. Visualizing the Relation as a Map
<visualizing-the-relation-as-a-map>
If you were to draw a knowledge map of this relationship, it would look
like a #strong[Spiral];.

+ #strong[The Axis:] The vertical pole is Bloom's Taxonomy (Depth).
+ #strong[The Cycle:] PUDAL is a circle winding around the pole.
+ #strong[The Movement:]
  - As you move from #strong[P] to #strong[U];, you climb slightly.
  - At #strong[D];, you spike up to the highest levels
    (Creating/Analyzing).
  - At #strong[A];, you drop down to practical ground level (Applying).
  - At #strong[L];, you climb back up to judge the whole process
    (Evaluating).

#strong[Summary for your Model:] The #strong[\[D\]] and #strong[\[L\]]
phases correspond to the "Higher Order Thinking Skills" (HOTS) in
Bloom's Taxonomy, while #strong[\[P\]];, #strong[\[U\]];, and
#strong[\[A\]] correspond to "Lower Order Thinking Skills" (LOTS). A
truly "Smart" system is defined by how robust its #strong[D]
(Design/Create) and #strong[L] (Evaluate) phases are.
