= Bloom's Taxonomy Knowledge Map
<blooms-taxonomy-knowledge-map>
When organizing knowledge according to Bloom's Taxonomy, a
#strong[Hierarchical Concept Map] is the most effective type of
knowledge map. This structure allows you to represent the different
levels of cognitive skills outlined in Bloom's Taxonomy, from basic
recall of facts to higher-order thinking skills like analysis and
creation. Bloom's Taxonomy categorizes cognitive skills into six levels:
1. #strong[Remembering:] Recalling facts and basic concepts. 2.
#strong[Understanding:] Explaining ideas or concepts. 3.
#strong[Applying:] Using information in new situations. 4.
#strong[Analyzing:] Drawing connections among ideas. 5.
#strong[Evaluating:] Justifying a decision or course of action. 6.
#strong[Creating:] Producing new or original work. To create a knowledge
map that reflects Bloom's Taxonomy, follow these steps:

transferable knowledge is often classified by Bloom taxonomy. wht kind
of knowledge map that is reflects Bloom taxonomy?

To represent transferable knowledge through the lens of Bloom's
Taxonomy, you cannot use a simple unstructured Brainstorming or Mind
Map. Those usually flatten information into a single layer of
importance.

Instead, the specific kind of map that reflects Bloom's Taxonomy is a
#strong[Hierarchical Concept Map] (or a #strong[Layered Knowledge
Graph];).

This map is structured #strong[vertically] or #strong[concentrically];,
moving from concrete facts at the bottom (or center) to abstract
connections and creations at the top (or outer edges).

Here is how you construct a knowledge map that mirrors the six levels of
Bloom's Taxonomy:

== 1. The Structure: From Surface to Deep
<the-structure-from-surface-to-deep>
In a standard mind map, all nodes are roughly equal. In a
#strong[Bloom's Map];, the visual depth represents cognitive depth.

=== Level 1: Remembering ( The Nodes)
<level-1-remembering-the-nodes>
- #strong[Map Element:] #strong[Isolated Nodes/Data Points.]
- #strong[What to map:] Definitions, formulas, dates, keywords.
- #strong[Visual:] Single words or boxes at the bottom of the page or
  the very center of the map.
- #emph[Example:] A node labeled "Supply" and a node labeled "Demand."

=== Level 2: Understanding (The Local Links)
<level-2-understanding-the-local-links>
- #strong[Map Element:] #strong[Labeled Connections (Propositions).]
- #strong[What to map:] Explaining #emph[why] two nodes are next to each
  other. You must label the line.
- #strong[Visual:] Short lines connecting the Level 1 nodes.
- #emph[Example:] Drawing a line between "Supply" and "Demand" labeled
  "interact to determine price."

=== Level 3: Applying (The Clusters)
<level-3-applying-the-clusters>
- #strong[Map Element:] #strong[Grouping/Zoning.]
- #strong[What to map:] Placing concepts into a specific context or
  scenario to solve a problem.
- #strong[Visual:] Drawing a boundary circle around a group of nodes and
  labeling the group with a use-case.
- #emph[Example:] Grouping Supply, Demand, and Price nodes inside a box
  labeled "Market Mechanism," then drawing an arrow to a box labeled
  "Housing Crisis" to show application.

=== Level 4: Analyzing (The Cross-Links)
<level-4-analyzing-the-cross-links>
- #strong[Map Element:] #strong[Long-range Bridges.]
- #strong[What to map:] Drawing connections between distinct, seemingly
  unrelated branches of the map to show patterns, cause-and-effect, or
  contradictions. This breaks the linear hierarchy.
- #strong[Visual:] Dashed lines cutting across the map, often colored
  differently (e.g., Red for "Contradicts," Blue for "Correlates with").
- #emph[Example:] Connecting "Market Mechanism" in the Economics branch
  to "Social Inequality" in the Sociology branch to analyze the
  relationship between efficiency and equity.

=== Level 5: Evaluating (The Annotations)
<level-5-evaluating-the-annotations>
- #strong[Map Element:] #strong[Visual Coding/Tagging.]
- #strong[What to map:] Judgments on the value, validity, or quality of
  the information.
- #strong[Visual:] Using color codes (e.g., Green = Proven, Red =
  Debunked) or adding "sticky note" icons to nodes with critiques.
- #emph[Example:] Marking the "Efficient Market Hypothesis" node with a
  question mark or a specific color indicating "Contested Theory."

=== Level 6: Creating (The Restructuring)
<level-6-creating-the-restructuring>
- #strong[Map Element:] #strong[The Meta-Map / New Branch.]
- #strong[What to map:] Taking the existing nodes and rearranging them
  entirely to form a new model or hypothesis.
- #strong[Visual:] A new, separate section of the map where elements are
  combined in a novel way to propose a solution.
- #emph[Example:] Drawing a new branch called "Sustainable Economics"
  that combines "Supply/Demand" with "Environmental Constraints" (from a
  Biology branch) to create a new circular economy model.

== Visual Layouts to Use
<visual-layouts-to-use>
To physically draw this, you can choose one of two distinct layouts:

=== A. The "Tree of Knowledge" (Vertical Hierarchy)
<a.-the-tree-of-knowledge-vertical-hierarchy>
- #strong[Bottom:] The roots are facts (Remembering).
- #strong[Trunk:] The main concepts (Understanding).
- #strong[Branches:] Applications of concepts (Applying).
- #strong[Cross-pollination:] Vines connecting different branches
  (Analyzing).
- #strong[Fruit:] New ideas generated from the synthesis (Creating).

=== B. The "Onion" (Concentric Map)
<b.-the-onion-concentric-map>
This is best for transferable knowledge systems (systems thinking). \*
#strong[Center Core:] Key Definitions (Remember). \* #strong[First
Ring:] Relationships and processes (Understand). \* #strong[Second
Ring:] Contexts where this applies (Apply). \* #strong[Outer Ring:]
Links to external systems (Analyze/Evaluate).

== Summary
<summary>
If you want a map that reflects Bloom's Taxonomy, #strong[you must
insist on labeled relationships.] \* A map with just words is a
#strong[Remembering] map. \* A map with unlabeled lines is an
#strong[Understanding] map. \* A map with labeled lines ("causes,"
"prevents," "requires") that connect distant concepts is an
#strong[Analyzing] and #strong[Creating] map.
