# Bloom's Taxonomy Knowledge Map
When organizing knowledge according to Bloom's Taxonomy, a **Hierarchical Concept Map** is the most effective type of knowledge map. This structure allows you to represent the different levels of cognitive skills outlined in Bloom's Taxonomy, from basic recall of facts to higher-order thinking skills like analysis and creation. Bloom's Taxonomy categorizes cognitive skills into six levels:
1. **Remembering:** Recalling facts and basic concepts. 
2. **Understanding:** Explaining ideas or concepts.
3. **Applying:** Using information in new situations.
4. **Analyzing:** Drawing connections among ideas.
5. **Evaluating:** Justifying a decision or course of action.
6. **Creating:** Producing new or original work.
To create a knowledge map that reflects Bloom's Taxonomy, follow these steps:

transferable knowledge is often classified by Bloom taxonomy. wht kind of knowledge map that is reflects Bloom taxonomy?

To represent transferable knowledge through the lens of Bloom’s Taxonomy, you cannot use a simple unstructured Brainstorming or Mind Map. Those usually flatten information into a single layer of importance.

Instead, the specific kind of map that reflects Bloom’s Taxonomy is a **Hierarchical Concept Map** (or a **Layered Knowledge Graph**).

This map is structured **vertically** or **concentrically**, moving from concrete facts at the bottom (or center) to abstract connections and creations at the top (or outer edges).

Here is how you construct a knowledge map that mirrors the six levels of Bloom’s Taxonomy:

## 1. The Structure: From Surface to Deep
In a standard mind map, all nodes are roughly equal. In a **Bloom’s Map**, the visual depth represents cognitive depth.

### Level 1: Remembering ( The Nodes)
*   **Map Element:** **Isolated Nodes/Data Points.**
*   **What to map:** Definitions, formulas, dates, keywords.
*   **Visual:** Single words or boxes at the bottom of the page or the very center of the map.
*   *Example:* A node labeled "Supply" and a node labeled "Demand."

### Level 2: Understanding (The Local Links)
*   **Map Element:** **Labeled Connections (Propositions).**
*   **What to map:** Explaining *why* two nodes are next to each other. You must label the line.
*   **Visual:** Short lines connecting the Level 1 nodes.
*   *Example:* Drawing a line between "Supply" and "Demand" labeled "interact to determine price."

### Level 3: Applying (The Clusters)
*   **Map Element:** **Grouping/Zoning.**
*   **What to map:** Placing concepts into a specific context or scenario to solve a problem.
*   **Visual:** Drawing a boundary circle around a group of nodes and labeling the group with a use-case.
*   *Example:* Grouping Supply, Demand, and Price nodes inside a box labeled "Market Mechanism," then drawing an arrow to a box labeled "Housing Crisis" to show application.

### Level 4: Analyzing (The Cross-Links)
*   **Map Element:** **Long-range Bridges.**
*   **What to map:** Drawing connections between distinct, seemingly unrelated branches of the map to show patterns, cause-and-effect, or contradictions. This breaks the linear hierarchy.
*   **Visual:** Dashed lines cutting across the map, often colored differently (e.g., Red for "Contradicts," Blue for "Correlates with").
*   *Example:* Connecting "Market Mechanism" in the Economics branch to "Social Inequality" in the Sociology branch to analyze the relationship between efficiency and equity.

### Level 5: Evaluating (The Annotations)
*   **Map Element:** **Visual Coding/Tagging.**
*   **What to map:** Judgments on the value, validity, or quality of the information.
*   **Visual:** Using color codes (e.g., Green = Proven, Red = Debunked) or adding "sticky note" icons to nodes with critiques.
*   *Example:* Marking the "Efficient Market Hypothesis" node with a question mark or a specific color indicating "Contested Theory."

### Level 6: Creating (The Restructuring)
*   **Map Element:** **The Meta-Map / New Branch.**
*   **What to map:** Taking the existing nodes and rearranging them entirely to form a new model or hypothesis.
*   **Visual:** A new, separate section of the map where elements are combined in a novel way to propose a solution.
*   *Example:* Drawing a new branch called "Sustainable Economics" that combines "Supply/Demand" with "Environmental Constraints" (from a Biology branch) to create a new circular economy model.

## Visual Layouts to Use

To physically draw this, you can choose one of two distinct layouts:

### A. The "Tree of Knowledge" (Vertical Hierarchy)
*   **Bottom:** The roots are facts (Remembering).
*   **Trunk:** The main concepts (Understanding).
*   **Branches:** Applications of concepts (Applying).
*   **Cross-pollination:** Vines connecting different branches (Analyzing).
*   **Fruit:** New ideas generated from the synthesis (Creating).

### B. The "Onion" (Concentric Map)
This is best for transferable knowledge systems (systems thinking).
*   **Center Core:** Key Definitions (Remember).
*   **First Ring:** Relationships and processes (Understand).
*   **Second Ring:** Contexts where this applies (Apply).
*   **Outer Ring:** Links to external systems (Analyze/Evaluate).

## Summary
If you want a map that reflects Bloom's Taxonomy, **you must insist on labeled relationships.**
*   A map with just words is a **Remembering** map.
*   A map with unlabeled lines is an **Understanding** map.
*   A map with labeled lines ("causes," "prevents," "requires") that connect distant concepts is an **Analyzing** and **Creating** map.
