The Direct Phase Mapping\n\n**[P] Perception of Stimuli $\\rightarrow$ Bloom Level: Remembering**\n*   **The Logic:** Perception is the retrieval or recognition of data. In a smart system, this is \"sensing.\" In Bloom's terms, this is the lowest level of cognition: recognizing that a specific fact or stimulus exists.\n*   *Bloom Action:* Recognizing, Listing, Describing (the raw input).\n\n**[U] Understanding $\\rightarrow$ Bloom Level: Understanding**\n*   **The Logic:** This is a 1:1 match. The system (or person) acts on the perceived data to determine context. It translates raw signals into meaning.\n*   *Bloom Action:* Interpreting, Classifying, Summarizing (the context).\n\n**[D] Decision/Design $\\rightarrow$ Bloom Level: Analyzing & Creating**\n*   **The Logic:** This is the most cognitively demanding phase.\n    *   **Decision** requires **Analyzing**: Breaking down the situation to look for patterns or causes.\n    *   **Design** requires **Creating**: Synthesizing those parts to formulate a new plan or strategy.\n*   *Bloom Action:* Differentiating (options), Organizing (logic), Planning (the output).\n\n**[A] Acting $\\rightarrow$ Bloom Level: Applying**\n*   **The Logic:** You are executing the plan designed in the previous step. In Bloom’s, \"Applying\" is defined as using a procedure in a given situation.\n*   *Bloom Action:* Executing, Implementing, Using (the plan).\n\n**[L] Learning/Evaluating $\\rightarrow$ Bloom Level: Evaluating**\n*   **The Logic:** The system looks at the result of the Action vs. the intent of the Design. It judges the quality of the outcome to update the model.\n*   *Bloom Action:* Checking, Critiquing, Judging (the delta between expected and actual).\n\n---\n\n## 2. The Integrated Model (The \"Smart Loop\")\n\nTo map this logically, you should view the relationship as a **Control Loop** where Bloom's Taxonomy dictates the \"intelligence\" of the PUDAL cycle.\n\nThere are two ways to view this relationship:\n\n### A. The \"Reflexive\" PUDAL (Low-Level Bloom)\nIf the system is simple (automation), the PUDAL cycle stays at the bottom of Bloom’s:\n*   **P:** Detects heat (Remember).\n*   **U:** Interprets as \"Too Hot\" (Understand).\n*   **D:** Selects pre-set rule \"Turn on Fan\" (Basic Application/Selection).\n*   **A:** Turns on Fan (Apply).\n*   **L:** Checks if temp dropped (Basic Evaluation).\n\n### B. The \"Cognitive\" PUDAL (High-Level Bloom)\nIf the system is smart (AI/Human Expert), the PUDAL cycle reaches the top of Bloom’s:\n*   **P:** Detects market anomaly (Remember).\n*   **U:** Interprets as a new emerging trend (Understand).\n*   **D:** **Synthesizes** a new investment strategy to exploit the trend (**Create/Design**).\n*   **A:** Executes the trade (**Apply**).\n*   **L:** **Critiques** the strategy's validity against global variables to update its mental model (**Evaluate**).\n\n## 3. Visualizing the Relation as a Map\n\nIf you were to draw a knowledge map of this relationship, it would look like a **Spiral**.\n\n1.  **The Axis:** The vertical pole is Bloom’s Taxonomy (Depth).\n2.  **The Cycle:** PUDAL is a circle winding around the pole.\n3.  **The Movement:**\n    *   As you move from **P** to **U**, you climb slightly.\n    *   At **D**, you spike up to the highest levels (Creating/Analyzing).\n    *   At **A**, you drop down to practical ground level (Applying).\n    *   At **L**, you climb back up to judge the whole process (Evaluating).\n\n**Summary for your Model:**\nThe **[D]** and **[L]** phases correspond to the \"Higher Order Thinking Skills\" (HOTS) in Bloom's Taxonomy, while **[P]**, **[U]**, and **[A]** correspond to \"Lower Order Thinking Skills\" (LOTS). A truly \"Smart\" system is defined by how robust its **D** (Design/Create) and **L** (Evaluate) phases are.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"km-03-pudal.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
